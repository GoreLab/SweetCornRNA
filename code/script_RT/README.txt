README (written by Ryokei Tanaka)

This is a folder to sahre my R codes for other project members. 
Note that these scripts may not be the final version.
I may put R codes under development, or I may change the R codes in the future.

My R codes assume that there is a RAWDATA folder in your working directory, where all the raw data files are stored.
Currently (Dec 10th, 2020), RAWDATA folder has the same subfolder structure as the shared google drive. 
For example, raw expression data is located under "RAWDATA/Seetcorn_TagSeq".
